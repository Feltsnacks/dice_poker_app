# Dice Poker

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Launch development server:

```sh
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files. You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.
