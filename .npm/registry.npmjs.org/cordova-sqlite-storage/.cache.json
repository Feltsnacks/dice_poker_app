the most widely used features and serves as the basis for the other versions.\n\n<!-- END About this version -->\n\n## Available for hire\n\nThe primary author and maintainer [@brodybits (Christopher J. Brody aka Chris Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) is available for part-time contract assignments. Services available for this project include:\n\n- Support for Ionic and other Angular derivatives\n- Single issue support\n- Warranty and support retainers\n- Priority fixes and enhancements\n- Custom feature development\n\nOther services available include:\n\n- Front-end/back-end development\n- Mentoring and training services\n\nFixed cost contract assignments are preferred.\n\nFor more information:\n- <http://litehelpers.net/>\n- <sales@litehelpers.net>\n\n<!-- END Services available -->\n\n## A quick tour\n\nTo open a database:\n\n```Javascript\nvar db = null;\n\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', function() {\n  db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'demo.db', location: 'default'});\n});\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Like with the other Cordova plugins your application must wait for the `deviceready` event.

Ideally you should be able to handle a callback with some data coming from a prompt.\n\nThese prereqisites are very well documented in a number of excellent resources including:\n- <http://cordova.apache.org/> (redirected from <http://cordova.io>)\n- <http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cordova/>\n- <https://ccoenraets.github.io/cordova-tutorial/>\n- <https://www.toptal.com/mobile/developing-mobile-applications-with-apache-cordova>\n- <http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cordova/index.htm>\n\nMore resources can be found by <https://www.google.com/search?q=cordova+tutorial>. There are even some tutorials available on YouTube as well.\n\nIn addition, this guide assumes a basic knowledge of some key JavaScript concepts such as variables, function calls, and callback functions.\n\n**MAJOR TIPS:** As described in the [Installing](#installing) section:\n- It is recommended to use the `--save` flag when installing plugins to track them in `config.xml`. If all plugins are tracked in `config.xml` then there is no need to commit the `plugins` subdirectory tree into the source repository.\n- In general it is *not* recommended to commit the `platforms` subdirectory tree into the source repository.\n\n**NOTICE:** This plugin is only supported with the Cordova CLI. This plugin is *not* supported with other Cordova/PhoneGap systems such as PhoneGap CLI, PhoneGap Build, Plugman, Intel XDK, Webstorm, etc.\n\n### Windows platform notes\n\nThe Windows platform can present a number of challenges which increase when using this plugin. The following tips are recommended for getting started with Windows:\n\n- First start to build and run an app on another platform such as Android or iOS with this plugin.\n- Try working with a very simple app using simpler plugins such as cordova-plugin-dialogs and possibly cordova-plugin-file on the Windows platform.\n- Read through the **Windows platform usage** of the [Installing](#installing) section.\n- Then try adding this plugin to a very simple app such as [brodybits / Cordova-sqlite-bootstrap-test](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-sqlite-bootstrap-test) and running the Windows project in the Visual Studio GUI with a specific target CPU selected. **WARNING:** It is not possible to use this plugin with the \"Any CPU\" target.\n\n### Quick installation\n\nUse the following command to install this plugin from the Cordova CLI:\n\n```shell\ncordova plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage --save\n```\n\nAdd any desired platform(s) if not already present, for example:\n\n```shell\ncordova platform add android\n```\n\n**OPTIONAL:** prepare before building\n\n```shell\ncordova prepare\n```\n\nor to prepare for a single platform, Android for example:\n\n```shell\ncordova prepare android\n```\n\nPlease see the [Installing](#installing) section for more details.\n\n**NOTE:** The new [brodybits / Cordova-sqlite-bootstrap-test](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-sqlite-bootstrap-test) project includes the echo test, self test, and string test described below along with some more sample functions.\n\n<!-- END Quick installation -->\n\n### Self test\n\nTry the following programs to verify successful installation and operation:\n\n**Echo test** - verify successful installation and build:\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', function() {\n  window.sqlitePlugin.echoTest(function() {\n    console.log('ECHO test OK');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Self test** - automatically verify basic database access operations including opening a database; basic CRUD operations (create data in a table, read the data from the table, update the data, and delete the data); close and delete the database:\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', function() {\n  window.sqlitePlugin.selfTest(function() {\n    console.log('SELF test OK');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**NOTE:** It may be easier to use a JavaScript or native `alert` function call along with (or instead of) `console.log`  to verify that the installation passes both tests. Same for the SQL string test variations below. (Note that the Windows platform does not support the standard `alert` function, please use `cordova-plugin-dialogs` instead.)\n\n### SQL string test\n\nThis test verifies that you can open a database, execute a basic SQL statement, and get the results (should be `TEST STRING`):\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', function() {\n  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'test.db', location: 'default'});\n  db.transaction(function(tr) {\n    tr.executeSql(\"SELECT upper('Test string') AS upperString\", [], function(tr, rs) {\n      console.log('Got upperString result: ' + rs.rows.item(0).upperString);\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nHere is a variation that uses a SQL parameter instead of a string literal:\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', function() {\n  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'test.db', location: 'default'});\n  db.transaction(function(tr) {\n    tr.executeSql('SELECT upper(?) AS upperString', ['Test string'], function(tr, rs) {\n      console.log('Got upperString result: ' + rs.rows.item(0).upperString);\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Moving forward\n\nIt is recommended to read through the [usage](#usage) and [sample](#sample) sections before building more complex applications. In general it is recommended to start by doing things one step at a time, especially when an application does not work as expected.\n\nThe new [brodybits / Cordova-sqlite-bootstrap-test](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-sqlite-bootstrap-test) sample is intended to be a boilerplate to reproduce and demonstrate any issues you may have with this plugin. You may also use it as a starting point to build a new app.\n\nIn case you get stuck with something please read through the [support](#support) section and follow the instructions before raising an issue. Professional support is also available by contacting: <sales@litehelpers.net>\n\n### SQLite resources\n\n- <http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/index.htm> with a number of helpful articles\n\n### Some other Cordova resources\n\n- <http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cordova/cordova_file_system.htm>\n\n<!-- END Getting started -->\n\n## Some apps using this plugin\n\n- [Trailforks Mountain Bike Trail Map App](http://www.trailforks.com/apps/map/) with a couple of nice videos at: <http://www.pinkbike.com/news/trailforks-app-released.html>\n- [Get It Done app](http://getitdoneapp.com/) by [marcucio.com](http://marcucio.com/)\n- [KAAHE Health Encyclopedia](http://www.kaahe.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=817): Official health app of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n- [Larkwire](http://www.larkwire.com/) (iOS version): Learn bird songs the fun way\n- [Tangorin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tangorin.app) (Android) Japanese Dictionary at [tangorin.com](http://tangorin.com/)\n- [GeoWiz.Biz](http://www.geowiz.biz/) Truck Tracker app with a [Personal Edition](http://geowiz.biz/personal-edition-login) available in the Android and iOS app stores\n\n<!-- END Some apps using this plugin -->\n\n## Security\n\n### Security of sensitive data\n\nAccording to [Web SQL Database API 7.2 Sensitivity of data](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#sensitivity-of-data):\n>User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially sensitive; it's quite possible for e-mails, calendar appointments, health records, or other confidential documents to be stored in this mechanism.\n>\n>To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data, it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.\n\nUnfortunately this plugin will not actually overwrite the deleted content unless the [secure_delete PRAGMA](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_secure_delete) is used.\n\n### SQL injection\n\nAs \"strongly recommended\" by [Web SQL Database API 8.5 SQL injection](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#sql-injection):\n>Authors are strongly recommended to make use of the `?` placeholder feature of the `executeSql()` method, and to never construct SQL statements on the fly.\n\n<!-- END Security -->\n\n# Avoiding data loss\n\n- Double-check that the application code follows the documented API for SQL statements, parameter values, success callbacks, and error callbacks.\n- For standard Web SQL transactions include a transaction error callback with the proper logic that indicates to the user if data cannot be stored for any reason. In case of individual SQL error handlers be sure to indicate to the user if there is any issue with storing data.\n- For single statement and batch transactions include an error callback with logic that indicates to the user if data cannot be stored for any reason.\n\n<!-- Avoiding data loss -->\n\n## Deviations\n\n### Some known deviations from the Web SQL database standard\n\n- The `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` static factory call takes a different set of parameters than the standard Web SQL `window.openDatabase` static factory call. In case you have to use existing Web SQL code with no modifications please see the **Web SQL replacement tip** below.\n- This plugin does *not* support the database creation callback or standard database versions. Please read the **Database schema versions** section below for tips on how to support database schema versioning.\n- This plugin does *not* support the synchronous Web SQL interfaces.\n- Known issues with handling of certain ASCII/UNICODE characters as described below.\n- It is possible to request a SQL statement list such as \"SELECT 1; SELECT 2\" within a single SQL statement string, however the plugin will only execute the first statement and silently ignore the others ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#551](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/551)\n- It is possible to insert multiple rows like: `transaction.executeSql('INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?,?),(?,?)', ['Alice', 101, 'Betty', 102]);` which was not supported by SQLite 3.6.19 as referenced by [Web SQL API section 5](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#web-sql). The iOS WebKit Web SQL implementation seems to support this as well.\n- Unlike the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) this plugin handles executeSql calls with too few parameters without error reporting. In case of too many parameters this plugin reports error code 0 (SQLError.UNKNOWN_ERR) while Android/iOS (WebKit) Web SQL correctly reports error code 5 (SQLError.SYNTAX_ERR) ref: https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#dom-sqlexception-code-syntax\n- Issues with positive and negative `Infinity` SQL parameter argument values are treated like `null` by this plugin on Android and iOS ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#405](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/405)\n- Positive and negative `Infinity` result values cause a crash on iOS/macOS cases ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#405](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/405)\n- Windows version fails with an error in case an `undefined` SQL parameter argument value is used.\n- Known issue(s) with of certain ASCII/UNICODE characters as described below.\n- Boolean `true` and `false` values are handled by converting them to the \"true\" and \"false\" TEXT string values, same as WebKit Web SQL on Android and iOS. This does not seem to be 100% correct as discussed in: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#545](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/545)\n- A number of uncategorized errors such as CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE USING bogus module are reported with error code 5 (SQLError.SYNTAX_ERR) on Android/iOS/macOS by both (WebKit) Web SQL and this plugin.\n- Issues with error code on Windows as well as Android with the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting described below.\n- In case of an issue that causes an API function to throw an exception (Android/iOS WebKit) Web SQL includes includes a code member with value of 0 (SQLError.UNKNOWN_ERR) in the exception while the plugin includes no such code member.\n- This plugin supports some non-standard features as documented below.\n- Results of SELECT with BLOB data such as `SELECT LOWER(X'40414243') AS myresult`, `SELECT X'40414243' AS myresult`, or reading data stored by `INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (X'40414243')` are not consistent on Android in case the built-in Android database is used (using the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting in `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase`) or Windows. (These work with Android/iOS WebKit Web SQL and have been supported by SQLite for a number of years.)\n- Whole number parameter argument values such as `42`, `-101`, or `1234567890123` are handled as INTEGER values by this plugin on Android, iOS (default UIWebView), and Windows while they are handled as REAL values by (WebKit) Web SQL and this plugin on macOS or iOS with WKWebView. This is evident in certain test operations such as `SELECT ? as myresult` or `SELECT TYPEOF(?) as myresult` and storage in a field with TEXT affinity.\n- INTEGER, REAL, +/- `Infinity`, `NaN`, `null`, `undefined` parameter argument values are handled as TEXT string values on Android in case the built-in Android database (`androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting) is used. (This is evident in certain test operations such as `SELECT ? as myresult` or `SELECT TYPEOF(?) as myresult` and storage in a field with TEXT affinity.)\n- In case of invalid transaction callback arguments such as string values the plugin attempts to execute the transaction while (WebKit) Web SQL would throw an exception. (This may cause the plugin to crash on Windows in case of a read-only transaction.)\n- The plugin handles invalid SQL arguments array values such as `false`, `true`, or a string as if there were no arguments while (WebKit) Web SQL would throw an exception. NOTE: In case of a function in place of the SQL arguments array WebKit Web SQL would report a transaction error while the plugin would simply ignore the function.\n- In case of invalid SQL callback arguments such as string values the plugin may execute the SQL and signal transaction success or failure while (WebKit) Web SQL would throw an exception.\n- In certain cases such as `transaction.executeSql(null)` or `transaction.executeSql(undefined)` the plugin throws an exception while (WebKit) Web SQL indicates a transaction failure.\n- In certain cases such as `transaction.executeSql()` with no arguments (Android/iOS WebKit) Web SQL includes includes a code member with value of 0 (SQLError.UNKNOWN_ERR) in the exception while the plugin includes no such code member.\n- If the SQL arguments are passed in an `Array` subclass object where the `constructor` does not point to `Array` then the SQL arguments are ignored by the plugin.\n- The results data objects are not immutable as specified/implied by [Web SQL API section 4.5](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/#database-query-results).\n\n### Security of deleted data\n\nSee **Security of sensitive data** in the [Security](#security) section above.\n\n### Other differences with WebKit Web SQL implementations\n\n- In case of a SQL error handler that does not recover the transaction, WebKit Web SQL (Android/iOS) would incorrectly report error code 0 while the plugin would report the same error code as in the SQL error handler. (In case of an error with no SQL error handler then Android/iOS WebKit Web SQL would report the same error code that would have been reported in the SQL error hander.)\n- In case a transaction function throws an exception, the message and code if present are reported by the plugin but *not* by (WebKit) Web SQL.\n- SQL error messages are inconsistent on Windows.\n- There are some other differences in the SQL error messages reported by WebKit Web SQL and this plugin.\n\n<!-- END Deviations -->\n\n## Known issues\n\n- iOS/macOS version does not support certain rapidly repeated open-and-close or open-and-delete test scenarios due to how the implementation handles background processing\n- As described below, auto-vacuum is NOT enabled by default.\n- The Android and Windows versions do not always handle four-byte UTF-8 characters emoji characters such as `\\u1F603` (SMILING FACE, MOUTH OPEN) correctly ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#564](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/564). It is sometimes possible to store and retrieve such characters but certain operations hex conversions do not work properly with the default [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) database implementation. It is suspected that such characters would be stored incorrectly in the Android and Windows versions.

The workaround is to call sqlite functions and [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client functions in separate ticks (using setTimeout with 0 timeout).\n- SQL errors are reported with an INCORRECT error code (0) on Windows ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#539](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/539). In certain cases SQL errors are also reported with error code 0 on Android in case the built-in Android database is used (using the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting in `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase`).\n- Possible crash on Android when using Unicode emoji _and other 4-octet UTF-8_ characters due to [Android bug 81341](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81341), which *should* be fixed in Android 6.x\n- Close/delete database bugs described below.\n- When a database is opened and deleted without closing, the iOS/macOS version is known to leak resources.\n- It is NOT possible to open multiple databases with the same name but in different locations (iOS/macOS).\n- Incorrect or missing rowsAffected in results for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE SQL statements with extra semicolon(s) in the beginning for Android in case the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` (built-in android.database implementation) option is used.\n\nSome more known issues are tracked in the [open Cordova-sqlite-storage bugs](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).\n\n<!-- END Known issues -->\n\n## Other limitations\n\n- ~~The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.~~ (No longer supported by the API)\n- Absolute and relative subdirectory path(s) are not tested or supported.\n- This plugin will not work before the callback for the 'deviceready' event has been fired, as described in **Usage**. (This is consistent with the other Cordova plugins.)\n- This plugin cannot support large records. TBD: specify maximum record; FUTURE TBD: to be fixed in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free) (available with GPL or commercial license options)\n- This version will not work within a web worker (not properly supported by the Cordova framework). Use within a web worker is supported for Android and iOS in: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free) (available with GPL or premium commercial license options)\n- In-memory database `db=window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: ':memory:', ...})` is currently not supported.\n- The Android version cannot work with more than 100 open db files (due to the threading model used).\n- SQL error messages on Windows version are not consistent with Android/iOS/macOS versions.\n- UNICODE `\\u2028` (line separator) and `\\u2029` (paragraph separator) characters are currently not supported and known to be broken in iOS, macOS, and Android version due to JSON issues reported in [Cordova bug CB-9435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-9435) and [cordova/cordova-discuss#57](https://github.com/cordova/cordova-discuss/issues/57). There *may* be a similar issue with certain other UNICODE characters in the iOS/macOS version (needs further investigation). This is fixed for iOS in: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-free) and [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free) (available with GPL or special commercial license options) as well as [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-workers-free) (available with GPL or premium commercial license options)\n- BLOB type is not supported in this version branch (*reading* of BLOBs is supported by [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-ext](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-ext) for Android/iOS)\n- UNICODE `\\u0000` (same as `\\0`) character not working in Android (default Android-sqlite-connector database implentation) or Windows\n- Case-insensitive matching and other string manipulations on Unicode characters, which is provided by optional ICU integration in the sqlite source and working with recent versions of Android, is not supported for any target platforms.\n- iOS/macOS version uses a thread pool but with only one thread working at a time due to \"synchronized\" database access\n- Large query result can be slow, also due to JSON implementation\n- ATTACH to another database file is not supported by this version. Attach/detach is supported (along with the memory and iOS UNICODE `\\u2028` line separator / `\\u2029` paragraph separator fixes) in: [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-attach-detach-free) (available with GPL or special commercial license options)\n- UPDATE/DELETE with LIMIT or ORDER BY is not supported.\n- WITH clause is not supported by older Android versions in case the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` (built-in android.database implementation) option is used.\n- User-defined savepoints are not supported and not expected to be compatible with the transaction locking mechanism used by this plugin. In addition, the use of BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK statements is not supported.\n- Problems have been reported when using this plugin with Crosswalk (for Android). It may help to install Crosswalk as a plugin instead of using Crosswalk to create the project.\n- Does not work with [axemclion / react-native-cordova-plugin](https://github.com/axemclion/react-native-cordova-plugin) since the `window.sqlitePlugin` object is *not* properly exported (ES5 feature). It is recommended to use [andpor / react-native-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage) for SQLite database access with React Native Android/iOS instead.\n\nSome more limitations are tracked in the [open Cordova-sqlite-storage documentation issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation).\n\n<!-- END Other limitations -->\n\n## Further testing needed\n\n- Integration with PhoneGap developer app\n- Use within [InAppBrowser](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/cordova_inappbrowser_inappbrowser.md.html)\n- Use within an iframe (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#368 (comment)](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/368#issuecomment-154046367))\n- Date/time handling\n- Maximum record size supported\n- Actual behavior when using SAVEPOINT(s)\n- R-Tree is not fully tested with Android\n- UNICODE characters not fully tested\n- ORDER BY random() (ref: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#334](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/334))\n- UPDATE/DELETE with LIMIT or ORDER BY (newer Android/iOS versions)\n- Integration with JXCore for Cordova (must be built without sqlite(3) built-in)\n- Delete an open database inside a statement or transaction callback.\n- WITH clause (not supported by some older sqlite3 versions)\n- Handling of invalid transaction and transaction.executeSql arguments\n- Use of database locations on macOS\n- Use of very large REAL numbers such as 1234567890123.4\n- More emojis and other 4-octet UTF-8 characters\n- `?NNN`/`:AAA`/`@AAAA`/`$AAAA` parameter placeholders ref: <https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#varparam>, <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html>)\n- Single-statement and SQL batch transaction calls with invalid arguments (TBD behavior subject to change)\n\n<!-- END Further testing needed -->\n\n## Some tips and tricks\n\n- If you run into problems and your code follows the asynchronous HTML5/[Web SQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) transaction API, you can try opening a test database using `window.openDatabase` and see if you get the same problems.\n- In case your database schema may change, it is recommended to keep a table with one row and one column to keep track of your own schema version number. It is possible to add it later. The recommended schema update procedure is described below.\n\n<!-- END Some tips and tricks -->\n\n## Pitfalls\n\n### Some common pitfall(s)\n\n- If a database is opened using the standard `window.openDatabase` call it will not have any of the benefits of this plugin and features such as the `sqlBatch` call would not be available.\n- It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction that has already finished, as described below. This is consistent with the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).\n- The plugin class name starts with \"SQL\" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with \"sql\" in small letters.\n- Attempting to open a database before receiving the 'deviceready' event callback.\n- Inserting STRING into ID field\n- Auto-vacuum is NOT enabled by default. It is recommended to periodically VACUUM the database.\n- Transactions on a database are run sequentially. A large transaction could block smaller transactions requested afterwards.\n\n### Some weird pitfall(s)\n\n- intent whitelist: blocked intent such as external URL intent *may* cause this and perhaps certain Cordova plugin(s) to misbehave (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#396](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/396))\n\n### Angular/ngCordova/Ionic-related pitfalls\n\n- Angular/ngCordova/Ionic controller/factory/service callbacks may be triggered before the 'deviceready' event is fired\n- As discussed in [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#355](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/355), it may be necessary to install ionic-plugin-keyboard\n\n### Windows platform pitfalls\n\n- This plugin does **not** work with the default \"Any CPU\" target. A specific, valid CPU target platform **must** be specified.\n- It is **not** allowed to change the app ID in the Windows platform project. As described in the **Windows platform usage** of the [Installing](#installing) section a Windows-specific app ID may be declared using the `windows-identity-name` attribute or \"WindowsStoreIdentityName\" setting.\n- A problem locating `SQLite3.md` generally means that there was a problem building the C++ library.\n\n### General Cordova pitfalls\n\nDocumented in: [brodybits / Avoiding-some-Cordova-pitfalls](https://github.com/brodybits/Avoiding-some-Cordova-pitfalls)\n\n### General SQLite pitfalls\n\nFrom <https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#section_1>:\n> SQLite uses a more general dynamic type system.\n\nThis is generally nice to have, especially in conjunction with a dynamically typed language such as JavaScript. Here are some major SQLite data typing principles:\n- From <https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#section_3>: the CREATE TABLE SQL statement declares each column with one of the following type affinities: TEXT, NUMERIC, INTEGER, REAL, or BLOB.\n- From <https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#section_3_1> with column type affinity determination rules: it should be possible to do CREATE TABLE with columns of almost any type name (for example: `CREATE TABLE MyTable (data ABC);`) and each column type affinity is determined according to pattern matching. If a declared column type name does not match any of the patterns the column has NUMERIC affinity.\n- From <https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#section_3_2>: a column with no data type name specified actually gets the BLOB affinity.\n\nHowever there are some possible gotchas:\n\n1. From <https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#section_3_2>:\n> Note that a declared type of \"FLOATING POINT\" would give INTEGER affinity, not REAL affinity, due to the \"INT\" at the end of \"POINT\". And the declared type of \"STRING\" has an affinity of NUMERIC, not TEXT.\n\n2. From ibid: a column declared as \"DATETIME\" has NUMERIC affinity, which gives no hint whether an INTEGER Unix time value, a REAL Julian time value, or possibly even a TEXT ISO8601 date/time string may be stored (further refs:  <https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#section_2_2>, <https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#section_3>)\n\nFrom <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phonegap/za7z51_fKRw>, as discussed in [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#546](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/546): it was discovered that are some more points of possible confusion with date/time. For example, there is also a `datetime` function that returns date/time in TEXT string format. This should be considered a case of \"DATETIME\" overloading since SQLite is *not* case sensitive. This could really become confusing if different programmers or functions consider date/time to be stored in different ways.\n\nFUTURE TBD: Proper date/time handling will be further tested and documented at some point.\n\n<!-- END pitfalls -->\n\n## Major TODOs\n\n- More formal documentation of API, especially for non-standard functions\n- Integrate with IndexedDBShim and some other libraries such as Sequelize, Squel.js, WebSqlSync, Persistence.js, Knex, etc.\n- Version with proper BLOB support\n- Further cleanup of [support](#support) section\n- Improve [brodybits / Cordova-sqlite-bootstrap-test](https://github.com/brodybits/Cordova-sqlite-bootstrap-test) to be a better app template\n- Add starter project with pre-populated database\n- Resolve or document remaining [open Cordova-sqlite-storage bugs](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)\n- Resolve [open Cordova-sqlite-storage documentation issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation)\n\n## For future considertion\n\n- Auto-vacuum option\n- Browser platform\n\n## Alternatives\n\n### Other versions\n\n- [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-ext](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-ext) - version with REGEXP support for Android/iOS/macOS and pre-populated database support for Android/iOS/macOS/Windows\n- [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-legacy-build-support](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-legacy-build-support) - maintenance of WP8 version along with the other supported platforms Android/iOS/macOS/Windows; limited support for PhoneGap CLI/PhoneGap Build/plugman/Intel XDK; limited testing; limited updates\n- [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter) - supports [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Android/iOS/macOS/Windows\n- [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-evcore-extbuild-free) - Enhancements for Android: JSON and SQL statement handling implemented in C, supports larger transactions and handles large SQL batches in less than half the time as this version.

Some other known deviations are documented below. Please report if you find any other possible deviations.\n- Single-page application design is recommended.\n- In case of a multi-page application the JavaScript used by each page must use `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` to open the database access handle object before it can access the data.\n\n**NOTE:** If a sqlite statement in a transaction fails with an error, the error handler *must* return `false` in order to recover the transaction. This is correct according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) standard. This is different from the WebKit implementation of Web SQL in Android and iOS which recovers the transaction if a sql error hander returns a non-`true` value.\n\nSee the [Sample section](#sample) for a sample with detailed explanations.\n\n## Opening a database\n\nTo open a database access handle object (in the **new** default location):\n\n```js\nvar db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'}, successcb, errorcb);\n```\n\n**WARNING:** The new \"default\" location value is *NOT* the same as the old default location and would break an upgrade for an app that was using the old default value (0) on iOS.\n\nTo specify a different location (affects iOS/macOS *only*):\n\n```js\nvar db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', iosDatabaseLocation: 'Library'}, successcb, errorcb);\n```\n\nwhere the `iosDatabaseLocation` option may be set to one of the following choices:\n- `default`: `Library/LocalDatabase` subdirectory - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud\n- `Library`: `Library` subdirectory - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes\n- `Documents`: `Documents` subdirectory - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud\n\n**WARNING:** Again, the new \"default\" iosDatabaseLocation value is *NOT* the same as the old default location and would break an upgrade for an app using the old default value (0) on iOS.\n\n*ALTERNATIVE (deprecated):*\n- `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: \"my.db\", location: 1}, successcb, errorcb);`\n\nwith the `location` option set to one the following choices (affects iOS *only*):\n- `0` ~~(default)~~: `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud\n- `1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes\n- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud (same as using \"default\")\n\nNo longer supported (see tip below to overwrite `window.openDatabase`): ~~`var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase(\"myDatabase.db\", \"1.0\", \"Demo\", -1);`~~\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the 'deviceready' event, as in the following example:\n\n```js\n// Wait for Cordova to load\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);\n\n// Cordova is ready\nfunction onDeviceReady() {\n  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'});\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe successcb and errorcb callback parameters are optional but can be extremely helpful in case anything goes wrong. For example:\n\n```js\nwindow.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'}, function(db) {\n  db.transaction(function(tx) {\n    // ...\n  }, function(err) {\n    console.log('Open database ERROR: ' + JSON.stringify(err));\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIf any sql statements or transactions are attempted on a database object before the openDatabase result is known, they will be queued and will be aborted in case the database cannot be opened.\n\n**OTHER NOTES:**\n- The database file name should include the extension, if desired.\n- It is possible to open multiple database access handle objects for the same database.\n- The database handle access object can be closed as described below.\n\n**Web SQL replacement tip:**\n\nTo overwrite `window.openDatabase`:\n\n```Javascript\nwindow.openDatabase = function(dbname, ignored1, ignored2, ignored3) {\n  return window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: dbname, location: 'default'});\n};\n```\n\n### iCloud backup notes\n\nAs documented in the \"**A User’s iCloud Storage Is Limited**\" section of [iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html) (near the beginning):\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><b>DO</b> store the following in iCloud:\n  <ul>\n   <li>[<i>other items omitted</i>]</li>\n   <li>Change log files for a SQLite database (a SQLite database’s store file must never be stored in iCloud)</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><b>DO NOT</b> store the following in iCloud:\n  <ul>\n   <li>[<i>items omitted</i>]</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n- <cite><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html\">iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n#### How to disable iCloud backup\n\nUse the `location` or `iosDatabaseLocation` option in `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` to store the database in a subdirectory that is *NOT* backed up to iCloud, as described in the section below.\n\n**NOTE:** Changing `BackupWebStorage` in `config.xml` has no effect on a database created by this plugin. `BackupWebStorage` applies only to local storage and/or Web SQL storage created in the WebView (*not* using this plugin). For reference: [phonegap/build#338 (comment)](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/338#issuecomment-113328140)\n\n<!-- END iCloud backup notes -->\n\n### Android sqlite implementation\n\nBy default, this plugin uses [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector), which is lightweight and should be more efficient than the built-in Android database classes. To use the built-in Android database classes instead:\n\n```js\nvar db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default', androidDatabaseImplementation: 2});\n```\n\n<!-- END Android sqlite implementation -->\n\n### Workaround for Android db locking issue\n\n[litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#193](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/193) was reported (as observed by a number of app developers) that when using the `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` setting on certain Android versions and if the app is stopped or aborted without closing the database then:\n- (sometimes) there is an unexpected database lock\n- the data that was inserted is lost.\n\nThe cause of this issue remains unknown. Of interest: [android / platform_external_sqlite commit d4f30d0d15](https://github.com/android/platform_external_sqlite/commit/d4f30d0d1544f8967ee5763c4a1680cb0553039f) which references and includes the sqlite commit at: http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/6c4c2b7dba\n\nThis is *not* an issue when the default [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) database implementation is used, which is the case when no `androidDatabaseImplementation` setting is used.\n\nThere is an optional workaround that simply closes and reopens the database file at the end of every transaction that is committed. The workaround is enabled by opening the database with options as follows:\n\n```js\nvar db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({\n  name: 'my.db',\n  location: 'default',\n  androidDatabaseImplementation: 2,\n  androidLockWorkaround: 1\n});\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This workaround is *only* applied when using `db.sqlBatch` or `db.transaction()`, *not* applied when running `executeSql()` on the database object.\n\n<!-- Workaround for Android db locking issue -->\n\n## SQL transactions\n\nThe following types of SQL transactions are supported by this version:\n- Single-statement transactions\n- SQL batch transactions\n- Standard asynchronous transactions\n\n**NOTE:** Transaction requests are kept in one queue per database and executed in sequential order, according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).\n\n**WARNING:** - It is possible to request a SQL statement list such as \"SELECT 1; SELECT 2\" within a single SQL statement string, however the plugin will only execute the first statement and silently ignore the others. This could result in data loss if such a SQL statement list with any INSERT or UPDATE statement(s) are included. For reference: [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#551](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/551)\n\n### Single-statement transactions\n\nSample with INSERT:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.executeSql('INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'], function (resultSet) {\n  console.log('resultSet.insertId: ' + resultSet.insertId);\n  console.log('resultSet.rowsAffected: ' + resultSet.rowsAffected);\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n});\n```\n\nSample with SELECT:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.executeSql(\"SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength\", [], function (resultSet) {\n  console.log('got stringlength: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).stringlength);\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n});\n```\n\n**NOTE/minor bug:** The object returned by `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` is **not** immutable. In addition, multiple calls to `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` with the same `rowNumber` on the same `resultSet` object return the same object. For example, the following code will show `Second uppertext result: ANOTHER`:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.executeSql(\"SELECT UPPER('First') AS uppertext\", [], function (resultSet) {\n  var obj1 = resultSet.rows.item(0);\n  obj1.uppertext = 'ANOTHER';\n  console.log('Second uppertext result: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext);\n  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n});\n```\n\n<!-- END Single-statement transactions -->\n\n### SQL batch transactions\n\nSample:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.sqlBatch([\n  'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MyTable',\n  'CREATE TABLE MyTable (SampleColumn)',\n  [ 'INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'] ],\n], function() {\n  db.executeSql('SELECT * FROM MyTable', [], function (resultSet) {\n    console.log('Sample column value: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).SampleColumn);\n  });\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('Populate table error: ' + error.message);\n});\n```\n\nIn case of an error, all changes in a sql batch are automatically discarded using ROLLBACK.\n\n<!-- END SQL batch transactions -->\n\n### Standard asynchronous transactions\n\nStandard asynchronous transactions follow the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) which is very well documented and uses BEGIN and COMMIT or ROLLBACK to keep the transactions failure-safe. Here is a simple example:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.transaction(function(tx) {\n  tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MyTable');\n  tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE MyTable (SampleColumn)');\n  tx.executeSql('INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?)', ['test-value'], function(tx, resultSet) {\n    console.log('resultSet.insertId: ' + resultSet.insertId);\n    console.log('resultSet.rowsAffected: ' + resultSet.rowsAffected);\n  }, function(tx, error) {\n    console.log('INSERT error: ' + error.message);\n  });\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);\n}, function() {\n  console.log('transaction ok');\n});\n```\n\nIn case of a read-only transaction, it is possible to use `readTransaction` which will not use BEGIN, COMMIT, or ROLLBACK:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.readTransaction(function(tx) {\n  tx.executeSql(\"SELECT UPPER('Some US-ASCII text') AS uppertext\", [], function(tx, resultSet) {\n    console.log(\"resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext: \" + resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext);\n  }, function(tx, error) {\n    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n  });\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);\n}, function() {\n  console.log('transaction ok');\n});\n```\n\n**WARNING:** It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction after it has finished. Here is an example from the **Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API post** at <http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html>:\n\n```Javascript\n  // BROKEN SAMPLE:\n  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: \"test.db\"});\n  db.executeSql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tt\");\n  db.executeSql(\"CREATE TABLE tt (data)\");\n\n  db.transaction(function(tx) {\n    $.ajax({\n      url: 'https://api.github.com/users/litehelpers/repos',\n      dataType: 'json',\n      success: function(res) {\n        console.log('Got AJAX response: ' + JSON.stringify(res));\n        $.each(res, function(i, item) {\n          console.log('REPO NAME: ' + item.name);\n          tx.executeSql(\"INSERT INTO tt values (?)\", JSON.stringify(item.name));\n        });\n      }\n    });\n  }, function(e) {\n    console.log('Transaction error: ' + e.message);\n  }, function() {\n    // Check results:\n    db.executeSql('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tt', [], function(res) {\n      console.log('Check SELECT result: ' + JSON.stringify(res.rows.item(0)));\n    });\n  });\n```\n\nYou can find more details and a step-by-step description how to do this right in the **Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API** post at: <http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html>\n\n**NOTE/minor bug:** Just like the single-statement transaction described above, the object returned by `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` is **not** immutable. In addition, multiple calls to `resultSet.rows.item(rowNumber)` with the same `rowNumber` on the same `resultSet` object return the same object. For example, the following code will show `Second uppertext result: ANOTHER`:\n\n```Javascript\ndb.readTransaction(function(tx) {\n  tx.executeSql(\"SELECT UPPER('First') AS uppertext\", [], function(tx, resultSet) {\n    var obj1 = resultSet.rows.item(0);\n    obj1.uppertext = 'ANOTHER';\n    console.log('Second uppertext result: ' + resultSet.rows.item(0).uppertext);\n    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**FUTURE TBD:** It should be possible to get a row result object using `resultSet.rows[rowNumber]`, also in case of a single-statement transaction. This is non-standard but is supported by the Chrome desktop browser.\n\n<!-- END Standard asynchronous transactions -->\n\n## Background processing\n\nThe threading model depends on which version is used:\n- For Android, one background thread per db;\n- for iOS/macOS, background processing using a very limited thread pool (only one thread working at a time);\n- for Windows, no background processing.\n\n<!-- END Background processing -->\n\n## Sample with PRAGMA feature\n\nCreates a table, adds a single entry, then queries the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.\n\n```js\n// Wait for ","maintainers":[{"name":"brodybits","email":"brodybits@litehelpers.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-11-22T14:15:02.378Z","created":"2015-05-26T18:10:11.505Z","0.7.8":"2015-05-26T18:10:11.505Z","0.7.9":"2015-05-26T19:00:00.627Z","0.7.10":"2015-08-04T17:47:02.207Z","0.7.11":"2015-10-19T16:04:30.527Z","0.7.12":"2015-11-15T22:06:23.805Z","0.7.13":"2015-11-17T11:06:28.477Z","0.7.14-pre":"2015-11-23T16:44:56.524Z","0.7.14":"2015-11-23T20:42:46.360Z","0.8.0":"2016-02-07T22:23:23.472Z","0.8.2":"2016-02-12T10:01:58.948Z","0.8.5":"2016-03-25T11:18:21.686Z","1.2.0":"2016-04-05T20:25:34.619Z","1.2.1":"2016-04-18T08:53:00.595Z","1.2.2":"2016-04-26T21:17:00.752Z","1.4.0":"2016-05-02T18:29:13.830Z","1.4.1":"2016-05-11T09:01:22.612Z","1.4.2":"2016-06-15T09:48:15.168Z","1.4.3":"2016-06-19T20:37:52.044Z","1.4.4":"2016-07-01T18:47:05.241Z","1.4.5":"2016-07-04T18:33:11.520Z","1.4.6-pre5":"2016-07-28T09:18:39.291Z","1.4.6-pre6a":"2016-07-29T17:06:54.246Z","1.4.6":"2016-08-02T15:33:50.064Z","1.4.7":"2016-08-22T23:11:30.002Z","1.4.8":"2016-10-10T09:31:02.573Z","1.4.9-cbfix1":"2016-11-21T13:59:26.080Z","1.4.9":"2016-11-21T14:18:57.807Z","1.5.0":"2016-11-22T12:10:31.082Z","2.0.0-edge01":"2016-11-22T14:15:02.378Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage","keywords":["sqlite","ecosystem:cordova","cordova-android","cordova-ios","cordova-windows"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage.git"},"author":{"name":"various"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"sourcesoft":true,"logik":true,"shanquan":true,"srbdev":true,"sidkb":true,"danail":true,"purplestarcb":true,"qlqllu":true,"sjlee4520":true,"dspjm":true,"mosin.bagban":true,"mutantodon":true,"noobapp":true,"lordkbx":true,"rossmartin":true,"django_wong":true,"eagleking":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"583452e6-19cd3\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 14:15:02 GMT"}
