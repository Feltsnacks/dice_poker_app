Here you can see an example of how to create a new instance for each one:\n\n```javascript\n// new MD5 instance\nvar MD5 = new Hashes.MD5\n// new SHA1 instance\nvar SHA1 = new Hashes.SHA1\n// new SHA256 instance\nvar SHA256 =  new Hashes.SHA256\n// new SHA512 instace\nvar SHA512 = new Hashes.SHA512\n// new RIPEMD-160 instace\nvar RMD160 = new Hashes.RMD160\n```\n\nAn example of how to generate an hexadecimal-based hash encoding for each algorithm:\n\n```javascript\n// sample string\nvar str = 'Sample text!'\n// output to console\nconsole.log('MD5: ' + MD5.hex(str))\nconsole.log('SHA1: ' + SHA1.hex(str))\nconsole.log('SHA256: ' + SHA256.hex(str))\nconsole.log('SHA512: ' + SHA512.hex(str))\nconsole.log('RIPEMD-160: ' + RMD160.hex(str))\n```\n\n### Browsers\n\nThis is a simple implementation for a client-side environment:\n\n```html\n<html>\n<head>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"src/hashes.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n// sample string\nvar str = 'This is a sample text!'\n// new MD5 instance and hexadecimal string encoding\nvar MD5 = new Hashes.MD5().hex(str)\n// output into DOM\ndocument.write('<p>MD5: <b>' + MD5 + '</b></p>')\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### node.js / io.js\n\n```javascript\n// require the module\nvar Hashes = require('jshashes')\n// sample string\nvar str = 'This is a sample text!'\n// new SHA1 instance and base64 string encoding\nvar SHA1 = new Hashes.SHA1().b64(str)\n// output to console\nconsole.log('SHA1: ' + SHA1)\n```\n\n### Command-line interface\n\nYou can use the simple command-line interface to generate hashes.\n\n```bash\n$ hashes sha1-hex This is a sample string\n> b6a8501d8a70e74e1dc12a6082102622fdc719bb\n\n# or with quotes\n$ hashes sha1-hex \"This is a sample string\"\n> b6a8501d8a70e74e1dc12a6082102622fdc719bb\n```\n\nFor more information about the options supported, type:\n\n```bash\n$ hashes -h\n```\n\n### Installation\n\nVia [npm](https://npmjs.org)\n\n```\n$ npm install jshashes\n```\n\nVia [Bower](http://bower.io/):\n```\n$ bower install jshashes\n```\n\nVia [Component](https://github.com/component/component):\n```\n$ component install h2non/jshashes\n```\n\nOr loading the script directly:\n```\nhttp://cdn.rawgit.com/h2non/jsHashes/master/hashes.js\n```\n\n## Public methods\n\nEach algorithm `class` provides the following public methods:\n\n* `hex(string)` - Hexadecimal hash encoding from string.\n* `b64(string)` - Base64 hash encondig from string.\n* `any(string,encoding)` - Custom hash algorithm values encoding.\n* `hex_hmac(key,string)` - Hexadecimal hash with HMAC salt key.\n* `b64_hmac(key,string)` - Base64 hash with HMAC salt key.\n* `any_hmac(key,string,encoding)` - Custom hash values encoding with HMAC salt key support.\n* `vm_test()` - Simple self-test to see is working. Returns `this` Object.\n* `setUpperCase(boolean)` - Enable/disable uppercase hexadecimal returned string. Returns `this` Object.\n* `setPad(string)` - Defines a custom base64 pad string. Default is '=' according with the RFC standard. Returns `this` Object.\n* `setUTF8(boolean)` - Enable/disable UTF-8 character encoding. Returns `this` Object.\n\n## Hash encoding formats supported\n\n* Hexadecimal (most extended)\n* Base64\n* Custom hash values `any()` method\n\n## Benchmark\n\nNode.js 0.6.18 running on a VPS Intel I7 930 with 512 MB of RAM (see `server/benchmark.js`)\n\n```javascript\nSimple benchmark test generating 10000 hashes for each algorithm.\nString: \"A0gTtNtKh3RaduBfIo59ZdfTc5pTdOQrkxdZ5EeVOIZh1cXxqPyexKZBg6VlE1KzIz6pd6r1LLIpT5B8THRfcGvbJElwhWBi9ZAE\"\n\n* MD5\n** Done in: 205 miliseconds\n* SHA1\n** Done in: 277 miliseconds\n* SHA256\n** Done in: 525 miliseconds\n* SHA512\n** Done in: 593 miliseconds\n* RMD160\n** Done in: 383 miliseconds\n```\n\nSee `client/benchmark.html` for client-side.\n\n## Notes\n\n* Don't support checksum hash for files on the server-side, only strings-based inputs are supported.\n* It has not been planned to include support for more hash algorithms.\n* The goal is to provide the same JavaScript code in both server and client side, so it isn't planned to improve it in other ways.\n* Only Node.js server-side was tested, so with minimal changes, you can setup `jsHashes` in other server-side JS environment.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* `1.0.7`\n  - Merge #37: fix terminator statement token.\n* `1.0.6`\n  - Fix #34: options `pad` typo.\n* `1.0.4`\n  - Fix CLI script call error when use it from Bash\n  - Added CLI usage example\n* `1.0.3`\n  - Important bugfixes to UTF-8 encoding (broken in 1.0.2) and the RIPEMD-160 hash (broken in 1.0.1).
