If you know you have a string and already\nknow its encoding then checkout [peek-stream](https://github.com/mafintosh/peek-stream).\n\n\n## Usage\nAs a function...\n```\nvar peek = require('buffer-peek-stream');\nvar readstream = fs.createReadStream('package.json');\n\npeek(readstream, 65536, function (err, data, outputStream) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  // outputStream is ready to be piped somewhere else\n  outputStream.pipe(somewhere_else);\n});\n```\n\nAs a stream...\n```\nvar PeekStream = require('buffer-peek-stream').BufferPeekStream;\n\nvar peek = new PeekStream(65536);\nvar readstream = fs.createReadStream('package.json');\n\n// peek will only emit the data event once\npeek.once('data', function (buf) {\n\n  // readstream is ready to be piped somewhere else\n  peek.pipe(somewhere_else);\n});\n\nreadstream.pipe(peek);\n\n// alternatively pipe `peek` here instead of in `data` callback\n```\n\n\n##
