Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)\n\n## Install\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save react-native-device-info\n```\n\n## Automatically link\n\n#### With React Native 0.27+\n\n```shell\nreact-native link react-native-device-info\n```\n\n#### With older versions of React Native\n\nYou need [`rnpm`](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm) (`npm install -g rnpm`)\n\n```shell\nrnpm link react-native-device-info\n```\n\n## Manually link\n\n### iOS (via Cocoa Pods)\nAdd the following line to your build targets in your `Podfile`\n\n`pod 'RNDeviceInfo', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-device-info'`\n\nThen run `pod install`\n\n### iOS (without Cocoa Pods)\n\nIn XCode, in the project navigator:\n- Right click _Libraries_\n- Add Files to _[your project's name]_\n- Go to `node_modules/react-native-device-info`\n- Add the `.xcodeproj` file\n\nIn XCode, in the project navigator, select your project.\n- Add the `libRNDeviceInfo.a` from the _deviceinfo_ project to your project's _Build Phases ➜ Link Binary With Libraries_\n- Click `.xcodeproj` file you added before in the project navigator and go the _Build Settings_ tab. Make sure _All_ is toggled on (instead of _Basic_).\n- Look for _Header Search Paths_ and make sure it contains both `$(SRCROOT)/../react-native/React` and `$(SRCROOT)/../../React` \n- Mark both as recursive (should be OK by default).\n\nRun your project (Cmd+R)\n\n(Thanks to @brysgo for writing the instructions)\n\n### Android\n\n#### With React Native 0.29+\n\n- in `MainApplication.java`:\n\n```diff\n+ import com.learnium.RNDeviceInfo.RNDeviceInfo;\n\n  public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {\n    //......\n\n    @Override\n    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {\n      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(\n+         new RNDeviceInfo(),\n          new MainReactPackage()\n      );\n    }\n    \n    ......\n  }\n```\n\n#### With older versions of React Native:\n\n- in `MainActivity.java`:\n\n```diff\n+ import com.learnium.RNDeviceInfo.RNDeviceInfo;\n\n  public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {\n    ......\n\n    @Override\n    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {\n      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(\n+       new RNDeviceInfo(),\n        new MainReactPackage()\n      );\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n(Thanks to @chirag04 for writing the instructions)\n\n## Device Name\n\nIf you want to get the device name in Android add this to your `AndroidManifest.xml` (optional):\n\n```xml\n...\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.BLUETOOTH\"/>\n```\n\n## Release Notes\n\nSee [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar DeviceInfo = require('react-native-device-info');\n\nconsole.log(\"Device Unique ID\", DeviceInfo.getUniqueID());  // e.g. FCDBD8EF-62FC-4ECB-B2F5-92C9E79AC7F9\n// * note this is IDFV on iOS so it will change if all apps from the current apps vendor have been previously uninstalled\n\nconsole.log(\"Device Manufacturer\", DeviceInfo.getManufacturer());  // e.g. Apple\n\nconsole.log(\"Device Brand\", DeviceInfo.getBrand());  // e.g. Apple / htc / Xiaomi\n\nconsole.log(\"Device Model\", DeviceInfo.getModel());  // e.g. iPhone 6\n\nconsole.log(\"Device ID\", DeviceInfo.getDeviceId());  // e.g. iPhone7,2 / or the board on Android e.g. goldfish\n\nconsole.log(\"System Name\", DeviceInfo.getSystemName());  // e.g. iPhone OS\n\nconsole.log(\"System Version\", DeviceInfo.getSystemVersion());  // e.g. 9.0\n\nconsole.log(\"Bundle ID\", DeviceInfo.getBundleId());  // e.g. com.learnium.mobile\n\nconsole.log(\"Build Number\", DeviceInfo.getBuildNumber());  // e.g. 89\n\nconsole.log(\"App Version\", DeviceInfo.getVersion());  // e.g. 1.1.0\n\nconsole.log(\"App Version (Readable)\", DeviceInfo.getReadableVersion());  // e.g. 1.1.0.89\n\nconsole.log(\"Device Name\", DeviceInfo.getDeviceName());  // e.g. Becca's iPhone 6\n\nconsole.log(\"User Agent\", DeviceInfo.getUserAgent()); // e.g. Dalvik/2.1.0 (Linux; U; Android 5.1; Google Nexus 4 - 5.1.0 - API 22 - 768x1280 Build/LMY47D)\n\nconsole.log(\"Device Locale\", DeviceInfo.getDeviceLocale()); // e.g en-US\n\nconsole.log(\"Device Country\", DeviceInfo.getDeviceCountry()); // e.g US\n\nconsole.log(\"App Instance ID\", DeviceInfo.getInstanceID()); // ANDROID ONLY - see https://developers.google.com/instance-id/\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"gantman","email":"gantman+npm@gmail.com"},{"name":"jeroenbourgois","email":"info@jeroenbourgois.be"},{"name":"lilach","email":"i.am.red@gmail.com"},{"name":"rebeccahughes","email":"rebecca@learnium.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-08-30T13:36:25.696Z","created":"2015-09-16T14:10:16.858Z","0.2.0":"2015-09-16T14:10:16.858Z","0.2.1":"2015-09-16T14:14:39.105Z","0.3.0":"2015-09-16T17:19:11.564Z","0.4.0":"2015-09-17T14:26:17.668Z","0.4.1":"2015-10-07T17:07:46.003Z","0.5.0":"2015-10-30T15:05:09.906Z","0.5.1":"2015-11-20T13:45:30.175Z","0.6.0":"2015-12-08T16:44:25.531Z","0.6.1":"2015-12-21T13:15:31.609Z","0.7.0":"2016-01-02T22:12:19.514Z","0.8.1":"2016-01-07T13:39:41.349Z","0.8.2":"2016-02-04T09:32:54.912Z","0.8.3":"2016-02-09T15:47:24.225Z","0.8.4":"2016-02-29T14:20:43.519Z","0.9.0":"2016-03-21T10:11:46.263Z","0.9.1":"2016-03-23T09:37:40.097Z","0.9.2":"2016-04-15T08:39:38.628Z","0.9.3":"2016-04-16T20:09:14.558Z","0.9.4":"2016-08-13T23:57:44.856Z","0.9.5":"2016-08-30T13:36:25.696Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info#readme","keywords":["react-component","react-native","ios","android","device","events","cocoapod"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info.git"},"author":{"name":"Rebecca Hughes","email":"rebecca@learnium.net","url":"https://github.com/rebeccahughes"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"rocman":true,"brien-crean":true,"ninozhang":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"AK5NUVC68DSKJKVI2D9MC2T6R\"","_cached":true}
