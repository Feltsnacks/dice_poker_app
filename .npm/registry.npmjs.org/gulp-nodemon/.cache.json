gulp-friendly nodemon wrapper that restarts your app as you develop, and keeps your build system contained to one process.\n\nPerfect for development.\n\n## Usage\n\n### **nodemon([options])**\n\nYou can pass an object to gulp-nodemon with options [specified in nodemon config](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#config-files).\n\nExample below will start `server.js` in `development` mode and watch for changes, as well as watch all `.html` and `.js` files in the directory.\n```javascript\n{\n  script: 'server.js'\n, ext: 'js html'\n, env: { 'NODE_ENV': 'development' }\n}\n```\n\ngulp-nodemon returns a stream just like any other NodeJS stream, **except for the `on` method**, which conveniently takes gulp task names to execute.\n\n### **.on([event], [tasks])**\n\n1. `[event]` is an event name as a string. See [nodemon events](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/events.md). (gulp-nodemon also provides a new event, `'change'`, which fires before the server restarts so that you can run your compile tasks all within the same gulp process.)\n2. `[tasks]` A gulp task name, array of gulp task names, or a function to execute.\n\n### **--debug**\n\nYou can also pass the debug flag to nodemon through the `nodeArgs` option\n\nExample below will start `server.js` in `development` with `--debug` flag.\n```javascript\n{ \n  script: 'app.js', \n  ext: 'js html', \n  env: { 'NODE_ENV': 'development' } , \n  ignore: ['./build/**'], \n  nodeArgs: ['--debug'] \n}\n```\n\nYou can also specify a custom debug port:\n```javascript\nnodeArgs: ['--debug=9999']\n```\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example will run your code with nodemon, lint it when your it change, then log a message when it nodemon runs it again.\n\n```javascript\n// Gulpfile.js\nvar gulp = require('gulp')\n  , nodemon = require('gulp-nodemon')\n  , jshint = require('gulp-jshint')\n\ngulp.task('lint', function () {\n  gulp.src('./**/*.js')\n    .pipe(jshint())\n})\n\ngulp.task('develop', function () {\n  nodemon({ script: 'server.js', ext: 'html js', ignore: ['ignored.js'] })\n    .on('change', ['lint'])\n    .on('restart', function () {\n      console.log('restarted!')\n    })\n})\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jacksongariety","email":"personal@jacksongariety.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-06-05T08:58:34.403Z","created":"2014-01-05T23:40:52.564Z","0.0.1":"2014-01-05T23:40:52.564Z","0.0.2":"2014-01-08T04:38:58.210Z","0.0.3":"2014-01-08T07:50:32.356Z","0.1.0":"2014-01-12T22:57:47.539Z","0.1.1":"2014-01-12T23:02:50.347Z","0.1.2":"2014-01-22T05:55:15.423Z","1.0.0":"2014-02-21T06:12:47.470Z","1.0.1":"2014-03-09T19:59:25.843Z","1.0.2":"2014-03-09T20:00:37.699Z","1.0.3":"2014-05-18T19:35:45.277Z","1.0.4":"2014-06-05T08:58:34.403Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon","keywords":["gulp","nodemon","develop","server","restart","automatically","watch","gulpfriendly"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon.git"},"author":{"name":"Jackson Gariety"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon/issues"},"license":"BSD-2-Clause","users":{"unkleara":true,"jacksongariety":true,"antoniobrandao":true,"mswanson1524":true,"abhisekp":true,"furier":true,"hal9zillion":true,"kabomi":true,"codeshrew":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"9IWHJS6HMK5ON8Q1Q5GOTX5NY\""}
