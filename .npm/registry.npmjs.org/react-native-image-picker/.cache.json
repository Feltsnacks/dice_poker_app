_Before you open an issue_\nThis library started as a basic bridge of the native iOS image picker, and I want to keep it that way. As such, functionality beyond what the native `UIImagePickerController` supports will not be supported here. **Multiple image selection, more control over the crop tool, and landscape support** are things missing from the native iOS functionality - **not issues with my library**. If you need these things, [react-native-image-crop-picker](https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker) might be a better choice for you.    \n\n# react-native-image-picker\nA React Native module that allows you to use native UI to select a photo/video from the device library or directly from the camera, like so:\n\niOS | Android\n------- | ----\n<img title=\"iOS\" src=\"https://github.com/marcshilling/react-native-image-picker/blob/master/images/ios-image.png\"> | <img title=\"Android\" src=\"https://github.com/marcshilling/react-native-image-picker/blob/master/images/android-image.png\">\n\n## Table of contents\n- [Install](#install)\n  - [iOS](#ios)\n  - [Android](#android)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Direct launch](#directly-launching-the-camera-or-image-library)\n- [Options](#options)\n- [Response object](#the-response-object)\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install react-native-image-picker@latest --save`\n\nUse [rnpm](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm) to automatically complete the installation, or link manually like so:\n\n### iOS\n\n1. In the XCode's \"Project navigator\", right click on your project's Libraries folder ➜ `Add Files to <...>`\n2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-image-picker` ➜ `ios` ➜ select `RNImagePicker.xcodeproj`\n3. Add `RNImagePicker.a` to `Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries`\n4. Compile and have fun\n\n### Android\n```gradle\n// file: android/settings.gradle\n...\n\ninclude ':react-native-image-picker'\nproject(':react-native-image-picker').projectDir = new File(settingsDir, '../node_modules/react-native-image-picker/android')\n```\n```gradle\n// file: android/app/build.gradle\n...\n\ndependencies {\n    ...\n    compile project(':react-native-image-picker')\n}\n```\n```xml\n<!-- file: android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml -->\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    package=\"com.myApp\">\n\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n\n    <!-- add following permissions -->\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" />\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\"/>\n    <uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera\" android:required=\"false\"/>\n    <uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera.autofocus\" android:required=\"false\"/>\n    <!-- -->\n    ...\n```\n```java\n// file: android/app/src/main/java/com/<...>/MainApplication.java\n...\n\nimport com.imagepicker.ImagePickerPackage; // <-- add this import\n\npublic class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {\n    @Override\n    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {\n        return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(\n            new MainReactPackage(),\n            new ImagePickerPackage() // <-- add this line\n        );\n    }\n...\n}\n\n```\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Platform = require('react-native').Platform;\nvar ImagePicker = require('react-native-image-picker');\n\n// More info on all the options is below in the README...just some common use cases shown here\nvar options = {\n  title: 'Select Avatar',\n  customButtons: [\n    {name: 'fb', title: 'Choose Photo from Facebook'},\n  ],\n  storageOptions: {\n    skipBackup: true,\n    path: 'images'\n  }\n};\n\n/**\n * The first arg is the options object for customization (it can also be null or omitted for default options),\n * The second arg is the callback which sends object: response (more info below in README)\n */\nImagePicker.showImagePicker(options, (response) => {\n  console.log('Response = ', response);\n\n  if (response.didCancel) {\n    console.log('User cancelled image picker');\n  }\n  else if (response.error) {\n    console.log('ImagePicker Error: ', response.error);\n  }\n  else if (response.customButton) {\n    console.log('User tapped custom button: ', response.customButton);\n  }\n  else {\n    // You can display the image using either data...\n    const source = {uri: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + response.data, isStatic: true};\n\n    // or a reference to the platform specific asset location\n    if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {\n      const source = {uri: response.uri.replace('file://', ''), isStatic: true};\n    } else {\n      const source = {uri: response.uri, isStatic: true};\n    }\n\n    this.setState({\n      avatarSource: source\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\nThen later, if you want to display this image in your render() method:\n```javascript\n<Image source={this.state.avatarSource} style={styles.uploadAvatar} />\n```\n\n### Directly Launching the Camera or Image Library\n\nTo Launch the Camera or Image Library directly (skipping the alert dialog) you can\ndo the following:\n```javascript\n// Launch Camera:\nImagePicker.launchCamera(options, (response)  => {\n  // Same code as in above section!\n});\n\n// Open Image Library:\nImagePicker.launchImageLibrary(options, (response)  => {\n  // Same code as in above section!\n});\n```\n\n\n#### Note\nOn iOS, don't assume that the absolute uri returned will persist.
