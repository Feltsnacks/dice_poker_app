Validating [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)\n(800 KB source) takes less than a second on a modern machine.\n* It looks only for **syntax errors**, it does not care about coding style\nat all.\n* It handles **generated files** as the result\nof minification or compilation (CoffeeScript, Dart, TypeScript, etc).\n* It would try to be **tolerant** and not give up immediately on the first\nerror, especially for strict mode violations.\n\nNote: The last feature is still a work-in-process, see Esprima\n[issue 130](http://code.google.com/p/esprima/issues/detail?id=130).\n\n## How to Use It\n\nFirst, install the [package](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-jsvalidate):\n\n    npm install grunt-jsvalidate\n\nModify your `Gruntfile.js` file to have the following line somewhere:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-jsvalidate');\n```\n\nIf it has been installed correctly, running `grunt --help` should\ninclude `jsvalidate` in the list of available tasks.\n\nSet the files to be validated, as part of Grunt configuration via the\nnew `jsvalidate` key. As an example, `initConfig` in your `Gruntfile.js`\nmight look like the following fragment:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  jsvalidate: {\n    files: ['*.js', 'lib/**/*.js', 'test/**/*.js']\n  },\n  nodeunit: {\n    files: ['test/**/*.js']\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can specify the files to be validated using the usual file pattern.\nIn the above examples, it will validate every `*.js` files in the main\ndirectory, the `lib` directory, and the `test` directory.\n\nWhenever you want the validation task to run, just invoke it using:\n\n```shell\ngrunt jsvalidate\n```\n\nIt is recommended to include the validation task in your default:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.registerTask('default', ['jsvalidate', 'jshint', 'nodeunit', 'concat', 'uglify']);\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 [Ariya Hidayat](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/about).\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.
